           <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Gabrielle Towson and I am a second year student at the University of Pittsburgh, originally from Washington D.C. I am currently an Urban Studies and Economics double major, with a minor in Public Service. One of the reasons that I choose to attend the University of Pittsburgh was because of the dynamic and evolving nature of the city itself. As an Urban Studies major, I am inherently interested in how cities are built, grown and supported, and have been able to follow this academic passion through my work at Pitt. In my free time I enjoy exploring different neighborhoods around Pittsburgh with friends. I also enjoy traveling and learning about different countries and cultures. This summer one of my favorite experiences was getting the opportunity to go to the San Blas islands in Panama, where I was able to spend a week camping on several of the islands in the San Blas archipelago.</p>

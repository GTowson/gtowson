            <p align="center">Hello! My name is Gabrielle Towson and I am a second year student at the University of Pittsburgh, originally from Washington D.C. I am currently an Urban Studies and Economics double major, with a minor in Public Service. One of the reasons that I choose to attend the University of Pittsburgh was because of the dynamic and evolving nature of the city itself.
As an Urban Studies major, I am inherently interested in how cities are built, grown and supported, and have been able to follow this academic passion through my work at Pitt.

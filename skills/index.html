            <p align="center"> Self-Guided Skills Development: Preliminary Curriculum </p>
          
<p>This semester I will be working towards gaining a basic understanding of web design. My focus area for this assignment will be centered around understanding how major non-profit organizations build compelling websites. I am currently interning at a non-profit organization and would like to apply the skills that I learn through this project to the work I’m doing at my internship site. My curriculum for this project is split into three parts: analyzing major non-profit websites (like Oxfam, the Red Cross, and Unicef) to see how they make use of different web design principles, watching the Lynda video series on design aesthetics for the web, and watching the second Lynda CSS essential training. I intend to spend about three hours researching non-profit websites and analyzing their web design choices. I plan on spending about three to four hours watching the Lynda video series on design aesthetics. I am also going to spend another four hours watching the second CSS essential training on Lynda.
